# dayz-dedicated-server-k8s

Run a DayZ Dedicated Server on Kubernetes.

Will deploy a DayZ Dedicated Server on your K8s cluster.  It deploys the linux server which is now available in the stable branch (main game client), see https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Hosting_a_Linux_Server .  Currently this is a vanilla deployment of the server.

Docker container based off the steamcmd container.  Read the k8s readme before using.  It is NOT meant to be fully fleshed out but a starting point for your own server.
